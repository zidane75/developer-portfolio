            <h3>flame breathing and Sword user</h3>
            <p>Flame Breathing (炎の呼吸, Honō no kokyū): This technique allowed me to increase the amount of oxygen in my
                blood
                by controlling my breathing pattern, which increased my strength and agility to equal that of a demon.so
                i
                work for Demon Slayer Corps.they do pay me for that.but i find web developing more fun.that's why i wont
                stop until i become web development hero.</p>

            <p>life is a beautiful journey that is meant to be embraced to the fullest every day. However, that doesn't
                mean you always wake up ready to seize the day, and sometimes need a reminder that life is a great gift.
